# Digital Identity Claimed Identity Collector

# di-ipv-cri-cic-front

Frontend for the Claimed Identity Collector

This is the home for the front end user interface for a credential issuer as a part of the Identity Proofing and Verification (IPV) system within the GDS digital identity platform. Other repositories are used for core services or other credential issuers.

# Installation

Clone this repository and then run

```bash
yarn install
```

## Environment Variables

All the required Environment Variables are inside the .env.sample file. Copy the contents on this file to a .env file in the same location, using the API locations specific for the envrionment you wish to test against.

- `CUSTOM_FE_URL` only needs to be populated if you would like to test against a custom deployed FE stack or if you wish to run browser-test against your local stack in which case set the value to be `http://localhost:5020`
- `API_BASE_URL` - URL to the ipv-cri-cic-api CRI back-end.
- `PORT` - Default port to run webserver on. (Default to `5020`)
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Secret used when configuring the HMPO session.
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_4_GTM_CONTAINER_ID` - Container ID for GA4 tracking.
- `UNIVERSAL_ANALYTICS_GTM_CONTAINER_ID` - Container ID for UA tracking.
- `GA4_ENABLED` - Feature flag to enable GA4, defaulted to `"true"`
- `UA_ENABLED` - Feature flag to enable UA, defaulted to `"false"`
- `ANALYTICS_DATA_SENSITIVE` - Redacts all form response data, defaulted to `"true"`. Only to be set to `"false"` if a journey section contains no PII in none text based form controls
- `GA4_PAGE_VIEW_ENABLED`- Feature flag to enable GA4 page view tracking, defaulted to `"true"`
- `GA4_FORM_RESPONSE_ENABLED`- Feature flag to enable GA4 form response tracking, defaulted to `"true"`
- `GA4_FORM_ERROR_ENABLED`- Feature flag to enable GA4 form error tracking, defaulted to `"true"`
- `GA4_FORM_CHANGE_ENABLED`- Feature flag to enable GA4 form change tracking, defaulted to `"true"`
- `GA4_NAVIGATION_ENABLED`- Feature flag to enable GA4 navigation tracking, defaulted to `"true"`
- `GA4_SELECT_CONTENT_ENABLED`- Feature flag to enable GA4 select content tracking, defaulted to `"true"`
- `LANGUAGE_TOGGLE_DISABLED` - Feature flag to disable Language Toggle, defaulted to `true`

## Run front-end locally against deployed back-end

- Set `API_BASE_URL` as described above.
- Replace all instances of `x-govuk-signin-session-id` with a valid session ID from the dev environment
- Run `yarn build` followed by `yarn start`

## Run front-end locally against deployed back-end

- Setup `.env` file as mentioned above
- Run `yarn build` followed by `yarn start`
- Make a `POST` call to the IPV_STUB_URL with the following body payload

```
{
"frontendURL": "http://localhost:5020"
}
```

- Start the journey from the but navigating to the `AuthorizeLocation` in the Stub response

# Deployment in own stack in DEV

To deploy a copy of the frontend infra from a local branch as a separate isolated stack in DEV:

- update the `Image:` tag in template.yaml to point to the container image to be deployed - this can be found by looking in ECR in the AWS Console for the latest image and tag.
- the run:

```shell
sam build --parallel --no-cached
sam deploy --resolve-s3 --stack-name "CUSTOM_STACK_NAME" --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --confirm-changeset --parameter-overrides \
"Environment=\"dev\" PermissionsBoundary=\"none\" VpcStackName=\"vpc-cri\" EnableScalingInDev=0"
```

Note the following parameters can be used to specify whether or not to deploy the autoscaling infra:

- `EnableScalingInDev` default to 0 which inhibits deployment of scaling infra in dev; set to 1 to deploy scaling infra
- `MinContainerCount` default is 3
- `MaxContainerCount` default is 12

# Request properties

In order to support consistent use of headers for API requests, [middleware](./src/lib/axios) is applied to add an instance of
[axios](https://axios-http.com/) on each request onto `req.axios`. This is then reused in any code that uses the API.

# Browser tests

Browser based tests can be run against a deployed API stack using the CIC-IPV Stub. To run the tests make sure you have urls pointing to the relevant envrionment filled out in your .env file and run `npm run test:browser`

Adding `CUSTOM_FE_URL=http://localhost:5020` will run browser tets against your local changes

These tests are written using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/javascript/) as the test runner and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as the automation tool. They also follow the [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-pom) for separation of concerns.

### Code Owners

This repo has a `CODEOWNERS` file in the root and is configured to require PRs to reviewed by Code Owners.

## Create and upload a custom image to ECR

Execute the following commands to create a custom image locally and push it up to ECR.
You need to have AWS credentials in your shell via `aws-vault` or `gds-cli` or similar.
`YOUR_REPO` needs to refer to an existing repo in ECR, you can create one in console if you don't have one already.

```shell
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 060113405249.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t di-ipv-cri-cic-front .
docker tag di-ipv-cri-cic-front:latest 060113405249.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev-images-viveakv
docker push 060113405249.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev-images-viveakv
```

Then to use this new image update the `Image:` tag in the template.yaml and redeploy your template locally in to your own stack in DEV.

### Dependency Installation

To use this locally you will first need to install the dependencies, this can be done in 2 ways:

#### Method 1 - Python pip

Run the following in a terminal:

```
sudo -H pip3 install checkov pre-commit cfn-lint
```

this should work across platforms

#### Method 2 - Brew

If you have brew installed please run the following:

```
brew install pre-commit ;\
brew install cfn-lint ;\
brew install checkov
```

### Post Installation Configuration

once installed run:

```
pre-commit install
```

To update the various versions of the pre-commit plugins, this can be done by running:

```
pre-commit autoupdate && pre-commit install
```

This will install / configure the pre-commit git hooks, if it detects an issue while committing it will produce an output like the following:

```
 git commit -a
check json...........................................(no files to check)Skipped
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
detect aws credentials...................................................Passed
detect private key.......................................................Passed
AWS CloudFormation Linter................................................Failed
- hook id: cfn-python-lint
- exit code: 4
W3011 Both UpdateReplacePolicy and DeletionPolicy are needed to protect Resources/PublicHostedZone from deletion
